# Links to weekly class materials

## Reminders: 
**Submission of assignments**: In certain asynchronous lessons, there are Assignment sections noted. For weeks 1-4, please let me (Dr. Chang) know via private Slack message when you are done with each of them. Due to their permissions settings, I can view files inside of your individual Biowulf course directories, making it unecessary for you to "submit" work in the traditional sense.

**Notes about course materials**: Links to weekly lessons will be provided several days in advance on this page. All course materials are living documents - some changes may be made after publishing to reflect our progress through the material.

## Week 1
**In-Class:**

-    [Introduction to Shell and the File System](../lessons/wk1_lesson01_intro_filesystem.md)

**Asynchronous:**
-  Optional: [Refresher on RNAseq](../lessons/01_intro-to-RNAseq.md): Since you already have RNAseq data, I am assuming some level of knowledge about where these data came from, in terms of sequencing technology, but here is some background if not. Let me know if you have any questions or want to discuss some of this in class!

-   [Wildcards and Shortcuts](../lessons/wk1_lesson02_wildcards_shortcuts.md) Est. 30 minutes
-   [Working with Files](../lessons/wk1_lesson03_working_with_files.md) Est. 30 minutes (contains Assignment)
