# Introduction to RNA-seq using high-performance computing (January 2025)

### Description

This repository has teaching materials for the first four weeks of a 9-week Introduction to RNA-sequencing data analysis workshop held at NICHD in 2025. This workshop focuses on teaching basic computational skills to enable the effective use of an high-performance computing environment to implement an RNA-seq data analysis workflow. It includes an introduction to shell (bash) and shell scripting, running the RNA-seq workflow from FASTQ files to count data and covers best practice guidelines for RNA-seq experimental design and data organization/management.

### Learning Objectives

1.  Understand the necessity for, and use of, the command line interface (bash) and HPC for analyzing high-throughput sequencing data.
2.  Understand best practices for designing an RNA-seq experiment and analyzing the resulting data.
